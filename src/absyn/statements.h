/**
 * This structs represent a statement in SPL.
 *
 * There exist many kinds of statements which, may all occur in a procedures body in SPL:
 *
 * 1. Empty statements are statements with no effect.
 *
 * 2. Compound statements are statements that combine different statements into a single one.
 * These are used whenever it is semantically necessary for many statements to act as one, for example the
 * body of a while-statement may only hold a single statement, which can be a compound statement
 * containing many statements itself.
 *
 * 3. Assign statements evaluates its right hand side expression and stores the value in the
 * variable on the left hand side of the assignment operator.
 *
 * 4. If-statements consisting of two branches and a conditional expression. Which of the two branches
 * is executed depends on the value of the condition.
 *
 * 5. While-statements consisting of a conditional expression and a body. The statement in the body is executed
 * until the condition evaluates to false.
 *
 * 6. Call statements represent a call of another procedure in SPL.
 * Whenever a procedure is called, additionally to the called procedures name, a list of expressions
 * has to be provided, whose types match the parameters of the called procedure.
 * Those expressions are then evaluated and passed as arguments to the called procedure, which is executed.
 * The execution of the current procedure is halted until the called procedure returns.
