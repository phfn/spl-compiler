 * calculated during phase 4.
 * There are two kinds of type expressions in SPL:
 *
 * 1. Named type expressions are type expressions, where the type is determined solely by its identifier.
 *
 * 2. Array type expressions which represent the type of an fixed-size array of another type expression.
 * They consist of the base type, which is the type of an arrays elements and a size, determining how many
 * of those elements an array of this type can hold.
